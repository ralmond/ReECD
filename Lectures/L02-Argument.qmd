# The Assessment Argument

![Toulmin Diagram](../img/Toulmin.png)

*Subject* person (or thing) being measured

*We* persons doing the measurement

-   *Claim*: What *we* want to say about *subject*

-   *Observation*: Something we see about *subject* (often in a certain *situation* or *context*)

-   *Warrant*: Reason to believe *observation* is associated with *claim*

-   *Alternative*: Reasons why *observation* could be present when *claim* does not hold

A *task* is a way of creating a *situation* in which *we* can make an *observation*.

### Example

-   **Claim:** The job candidate can produce appropriate and relevant routine business correspondence.

-   **Observation:** The candidate's cover letter was well written.

-   **Warrant:** A cover letter is a type of business correspondence, therefore this is a positive example of the type of needed work.

-   **Alternative:** The candidate may have had help writing or correcting the letter.

# Task and Task Features Features {#sec-Variables}

A task is a sequence of actions a subject performs in pursuit of a goal.

A task, particularly in an assessment, has a number of parts:

-   *Prompt* -- Statement of the goals of the task
    -   Explicit prompt (what is written down or said)
    -   Implicit prompt (instructions subject is assumed to know)
    -   Rubric -- set of instructions
    -   Scoring Rubric -- information about how task is awarded points
-   *Resources*
    -   Content
    -   Tools
    -   Collaborators
    -   Internal (subject's experiences and memory)
-   *Work Product and Process* (WPP)
    -   Work product is what is produced
        -   selection
        -   Document
        -   Simulator state
    -   Work process is series of steps taken to reach goal
        -   Log file
        -   Audio/video transcript

## Feature and observable variables

A *task feature* is a variable that describes some aspect of a task prompt or resources.

An *observable variable* (*indicator*, *observable*) is a variable that describes the realized work product or process.

### Variable Trichotomy

There are three aspects to a variable definition:

-   *Domain*: possible values variable could take on.
-   *Value*: the value it takes a particular situation
-   *Evaluator*: a rule or procedure for determining its value.

### Clarity Test

A variable passes the clarity test if running the evaluator in a particular situation produces an unambiguous result [@HowardMatheson1981].

*Latent variables* are variables that don't pass the clarity test. Their value must be inferred from observations.

## Situational variables

-   Task features -- task goal and resources
    -   Response type
    -   Skill demands
    -   Kind and length of research material
-   Environment features -- environment properties and affordances
    -   distractions
    -   security
    -   tool availability
-   Person features -- features of the *subject*, usually related to their experience
    -   biological
    -   preparation
    -   aversions
-   Interaction features
    -   Person by task: familiarity
    -   Person by environment: ADHD and noisy environment
    -   Task by environment: Calculation demand and calculator availability

## Situtations and Contexts

-   A *situation* is a collection of variables describing a particular point in time and space.

    -   In a *situation* all variable have an assigned value.

-   A *context* is a set of situations.

-   Variables may be unknown, or restricted to a set.

-   Some contexts are nested within others.

## Observables (Indicators) and Claims

Observables or indicators are features of the outcome (work product or process) of a task.

What *subject* did, wrote, said, indicated, &c

An *observation* is a realized observable, usually in a particular situation.

A *claim* is a prediction about a future observation, in a *context* (set of possible situations).

# Constructs

A *construct* is a latent variable associated with a collection of related claims.

-   Skill in academic construct

-   Latent trait or state

-   Psychological syndrome

Different levels of the construct are associated with different claims.

*Russell's Rule* \| For different levels of the construct to be identifiable, there must be at \| least one different claim associated with each level.

## Assessments

An *assessment* is a series of assigned tasks, whose observation will be used to assign a value to a construct.

Generally, the *context* in an assessment is constrained.

![Construct Diagram](../img/ToulminConstruct.png)

## Contexts and Situtaions with Constructs

Let *context* be the constrained context of the assessment.

Let \_context\*\_ be the less constrained context of the claim.

![Toulmin Diagram with Contexts](../img/ToulminCC.png)

# Logical Reasoning

-   Hypothesis: $H$ -- construct is within a certain set of values

    -   $\overline{H}$ -- negation of hypothesis

-   $C_1, C_2, \ldots$ -- claims

-   $E_1, E_2, \ldots$ -- observations.

## Deduction

$H \rightarrow E$

Often add probability, so $P(E|H) \ge P(E|\overline{H})$

*Weight of Evidence* $$ WOE(H\mathord{:}E) = \log { \frac{\Pr (E |H)}{\Pr (E | \overline H )} }
= \log { \frac{\Pr (H | E)}{\Pr (\overline H | E)} } -
\log { \frac{\Pr (H )}{\Pr (\overline H )} } $$

### Radicals and incidentals

Let $Z$ be a feature variable, and $z_1$ and $z_2$ two possible values.

A feature variable is *radical* if $P(E|H,Z=z_1) \ne P(E|H,Z=z_2)$ or $P(E|\overline{H},Z=z_1) \ne P(E|\overline{H},Z=z_2)$

A feature variable is *incidental* if it is not radical. It is approximately incidental if the probability of the $z_2$ value is low.

## Abduction

$H \leftarrow E$

Reversing the arrow can be done with Bayes Rule

$$ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E|H)P(H) + 
P(E|\overline{H})P(\overline{H})} $$

Often not enough evidence from single observation to make good prediction.

There is dependence on the *base rate* $P(H)$.

## Induction

Repeated observation indicates the claim holds.

-   Sun rises every morning, so sun will rise tomorrow.
-   Every swan I've seen is white, so all swans are white:

![Black swan I saw in Australia](../img/BlackSwan.jpg)

Sample of situations in assessment must be a representative sample of the target Context\* in the claim.

# Validity Argument

Use induction and abduction to go from observations, in a collection of situations, to constructs.

Use deduction to go from construct to claims in a certain context or set of contexts.

Need to be careful about which contexts are covered in the claims.

## Sensitivity and Specificity

$T$ -- test result indicates claim holds $C$ -- claim holds.

Sensitivity: $P(T|C)$

Specificity: $P(\overline{T}|\overline{C})$

[Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity)

## False Positives and Negatives

False positives and false negatives have different costs based on the use of the assessment.

Need for sensitivity and specificity depends on use of the assessment.

Can adjust cut score to trade sensitivity and specificity.

*Receiver operating characteristic* or *ROC curve*:

![ROC Curve](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6b/Roccurves.png/220px-Roccurves.png)

More area under curve means better assessment.

Usually requires longer assessment.
