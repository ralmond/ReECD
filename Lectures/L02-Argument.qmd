# The Assessment Argument

![Toulmin Diagram](../img/Toulmin.png)



_Subject_ person (or thing) being measured

_We_ persons doing the measurement

* _Claim_:  What _we_ want to say about _subject_

* _Observation_: Something we see about _subject_ (often in a certain _situation_ or _context_)

* _Warrant_: Reason to believe _observation_ is associated with _claim_

* _Alternative_: Reasons why _observation_ could be present when _claim_ does not hold

A _task_ is a way of creating a _situation_ in which _we_ can make an _observation_.

### Example


-   **Claim:** The job candidate can produce appropriate and relevant
    routine business correspondence.

-   **Observation:** The candidate's cover letter was well written.

-   **Warrant:** A cover letter is a type of business correspondence,
    therefore this is a positive example of the type of needed work.

-   **Alternative:** The candidate may have had help writing or
    correcting the letter.

# Variables, Indicators and Context Features {#sec-Variables}

There are three aspects to a variable definition:

* _Domain_:  possible values variable could take on.
* _Value_: the value it takes a particular situation
* _Evaluator_:  a rule or procedure for determining its value.

## Situational variables

* Task features -- task goal and resources
  - Response type
  - Skill demands
  - Kind and length of research material

* Environment features -- environment properties and affordances
  - distractions
  - security
  - tool availability

* Person features -- features of the _subject_, usually related to their experience
 - biological
 - preparation
 - aversions
 
* Interaction features
 - Person by task:  familiarity
 - Person by environment:  ADHD and noisy environment
 - Task by environment:  Calculation demand and calculator availability

## Situtations and Contexts

* A _situation_ is a collection of variables describing a particular point in time and space.  
  - In a _situation_ all variable have an assigned value.

* A _context_ is a set of situations.

 - Variables may be unknown, or restricted to a set.
 
 - Some contexts are nested within others.

## Indicators {#sec-Indicators}

Indicators are features of the outcome (work product or process) of a task.

What _subject_ did, wrote, said, indicated, &c
